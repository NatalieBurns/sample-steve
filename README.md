# Unburns.com Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for [Unburns.com](https://www.unburns.com), the personal website of Natalie Burns. This project encompasses the code and resources used to create and maintain the website, hosted on DigitalOcean and registered through Namecheap.

## Overview

Unburns.com is a portfolio and blogging platform designed to showcase my professional work and personal musings. The site is built with modern web technologies and designed to be responsive and accessible.

## Features

- **Permanent Redirect**: The naked domain `unburns.com` uses `pizza.redirect` to permanently redirect to `https://www.unburns.com`, ensuring consistency and search engine optimization.

- **DNS Management**: DNS is managed at 

    - `NS1.digitalocean.com`, 
    - `NS2.digitalocean.com`, 
    - `NS3.digitalocean.com`, 
    
    providing reliable and scalable domain name resolution.

- **Development Environment**: Code is written and maintained using Visual Studio Code, a powerful and versatile code editor.
